# old-stuff-to-keep

A mix of ancient tools to keep alive on the internet and in the Arctic Vault.

## List of tools

* **Sharescan.exe** - Scans for network shares on the network quite rapidly. An old tool written for McAfee by Robin Keir <keir.net> but now hard to find.

* **winfo.exe** - Attempts to perform a null-session NBT attack. (c) Arne Vidstrom.

* **nat10bin.zip** - Netbios Security Kit. Simple bruteforce attempts for NBT. (c) nat-dev@secnet.com.

* **Winfingerprint.zip** - Windows enumeration and scanning. (c) Kirby Kuehl 1999.

Continually expanding when I need something old and find it...

#### Feel free to ping me if you're the owner and would like something removed (as long as you upload to git yourself afterwards!)
